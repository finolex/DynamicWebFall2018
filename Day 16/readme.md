Steps to running an aweesome express/node.js app that let's a user type in a number, and shows them a random trivia about that number:
1. Pull/Fork the repository locally
2. Navigate to the folder via your terminal
3. In the root folder, in your terminal:
    1. "npm i express body-parser request ejs nodemon"
4. Navigate to http://localhost:3000 in your browser
5. Follow the app's instructions!

Enjoy! <3
