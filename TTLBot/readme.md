Instructions for SlackBot!

1. Assuming you have the files and tokens necessary (which is a long process that I shall'nt explain here because that is out of the scope of my documentation), navigate to root folder
2. Launch node local server with 'node start'
3. You'll notice that your terminal should show that the bot has started
4. You may now navigate to your slack general channel, and type '@llbottest search *insert username of interested person* *insert ttl or ll depending on which you want to search for*
5. The bot should automatically respond to you with how many LLs or TTLs the user you requested for, has.

PS: Username is in terms of the email (so for example, when signing up, my email I used was ac5847@nyu.edu, so my username is ac5847)
PPS: For now, the bot only recognises the two terms 'll' and 'ttl', and only in that format (small cased and no spaces).
